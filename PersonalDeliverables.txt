Eric Steve (esteve-ship-it)

I am looking into doing some logic control sensing programming. My
major is Electrical and Computer engineering (double major) and this
is my final semester here. I will notify you of any testing of code or
other activities. I will also make sure that the repository is well 
documented and properly merged.
