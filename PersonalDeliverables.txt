I am looking into doing some logic control sensing programming. My
major is Electrical and Computer engineering (double major) and this
is my final semester here. I will notify you of any testing of code or
other activities. I will also make sure that the repository is well 
documented and properly merged.

From the Killer Drone project, I am looking to utilize skills learned
in a practical setting and to continue to improve programming knowledge. 
I am an electrical engineering major, and this is my second semester in 
WCE. I will notify the group of any changes I complete as well as document
notes from the meetings.
